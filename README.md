# Technical writing overview

Documentation is an integral part of business management and software development. It's essential for project adoption. These guides and tutorials describe how to create high-quality documentation for your project, regardless of your skill level as an engineer.

## Why is documentation important?

- **Future-proof your project**: Prevent knowledge loss if a critical member leaves the team and create a strong bedrock for ongoing support.
- **Faster onboarding**: New clients and project teams can more easily integrate with a team that maintains accurate documentation without pinging more senior team members for help.
- **Share with clients**: Provide enhanced transparency for clients by tying documentation with development, allowing them to follow along with your progress easily.
- **Prepare your project for external readers**: If it's externally facing, it's only as valuable as its external documentation. Ensure that your project has an excellent user experience by investing time in documentation.
