# Develop a content strategy

The quality and effectiveness of all documentation can be measured against three traits: *readability*, *accuracy*, and *discoverability*. These traits are often used to determine documentation quality, but you can also use them to establish goals for creating a documentation strategy.

## Readability

While the prose is an essential factor in documentation, readability broadly considers who the documentation is targeted toward and how it's written.

Before you begin writing:

- Determine who your audience will be.
- Tailor your information architecture to user personas.
- Be concise and use everyday language.
- Organize your documentation into descriptive and task-based information.

### Audience

To be truly useful, your docs must address the needs of specific users. When you craft your documentation plan, it's essential to ask yourself these critical questions about your readers:

- Who are the users?
- What are their job functions?
- Are they technical or non-technical?
- Are they internal or external to the organization?
- What is their average knowledge level of the technical content?
- What do they need to know to get started?
- How do they process information?

### Personas

The way you write your documentation will be influenced by understanding the types of users that are likely to consume it. Establishing one or more reader personas will define how technical and detailed your documentation should be.

### Keep it simple

Write for your most challenging reader, not your most agreeable one. Most readers don't want to sift through text to get an answer. Others have a hard time understanding business jargon. Some readers always take ambiguous wording the wrong way.

Using everyday language and avoiding ambiguity can drastically improve any document's readability.

### Descriptive versus task-based information

Documentation is typically split between two types of information: *descriptive* and *task-based*.

- Descriptive information *describes* something. It provides context around a component or topic.
- Task-based information tells *how to do something*. It's typically written in an active voice and directs the reader to perform one or more actions.

Both types of information are necessary within documentation. Splitting them into two distinct sections is recommended to improve readability.

## Accuracy

Inaccurate documentation doesn't provide helpful information. It wastes time, sends users down the wrong path, increases the time developers must spend supporting their projects, and breaks any semblance of trust that may have been established with the reader.

Ensuring that documentation is readable is crucial, but verifying its accuracy is equally important.

### Technical reviews

To ensure accurate documentation, a series of technical reviews with the original feature developer should be performed throughout the process. The first review should occur before any documentation is written. This gives the writer time to understand the necessary information before putting it on paper.

After the initial draft is written, a second review should be performed to verify the accuracy of the written piece. This ensures documentation is written from a *new* user's perspective while allowing clients to correct any misunderstandings or assumptions before publishing.

## Discoverability

The final trait of high-quality documentation is discoverability. It doesn't matter how accurate or readable documentation is if the user can't find the information they're looking for. Discoverability can be accomplished in several ways.

### Information architecture

Establishing an intuitive and browseable information architecture is vital to making documentation discoverable. It enables readers to find the information they need about a given feature. A simple way of accomplishing this is establishing a set of topic-based hierarchies to categorize documentation.

Identify gaps in your documentation structure (or information architecture). Plan your documentation structure around the user journey — think about what the user needs to see — and the logical progression they take when looking for answers in your docs.

### Usability

Usability, in the context of documentation, means structuring single-page documentation with ease of use in mind. Little things like syntax highlighting code snippets, descriptive animated GIFs, and a “More info” section can make documentation easier to read and parse.

### Search

Indexing documentation and providing a mechanism to search it can make up for any failings in the other two categories. Search *is* the most common definition of “discoverability.”
