# Grammar and mechanics

Follow these conventions for capitalization, emphasis, contractions, punctuation, tables, and graphics.

## Capitalization

Write the name of the window, tab, field, menu option, and so on as it's displayed in the application, but keep such words as field, tab, and window in lowercase.

## Contractions

Use contractions freely. You're writing for readers, not for an AI.

## Default values

Indicate that a field defaults to a value, and specify the default value when possible. When possible, explain when and why a default should or should not be changed.

## Emphasis

- Use *italics* for emphasis, rather than capital letters, underlining, quotes, or bolding text. Only use bold when *no other option exists*.
- Use bold for UI elements such as checkboxes, buttons, tabs, and field names.
- Do *not* bold or capitalize the word *not*.

## Formatting

- For external links, the title should reflect how it's displayed on the page or link itself.
- Hyperlink *all* email addresses. Avoid linking a specific person's email address. Use a distribution list when available.
- Do not personify/anthropomorphize software projects. For example, "The project actually knows both realized amounts".

## Headings

All headings should be in sentence case.

| Use | Don't use |
|---|---|
| Balance sheet substantiation tasks by role | Balance Sheet Substantiation Tasks by Role |

## Introductions for pages, lists, and other items

Every page needs an introduction. An introductory sentence is also required before lists, steps, and tables. Avoid long words or extraneous phrases, such as "do the following". Let a colon do the work.

Don't introduce hyperlinks if they're self-explanatory.

- The wording of links doesn't have to match the topic it jumps to, but it should be close enough for users to know they went to the right place.
- When possible, link directly to a topic using existing text. Avoid using "see".

## Numerals

*Always* spell out numerals zero through nine unless you're referring to a specific step in a procedure.

| Use | Don't use |
|---|---|
| three | 3 |

Use parentheses when specifying a negative number.

| Use | Don't use |
|---|---|
| (10,000) | -$10,000 |

## Punctuation

Use serial/Oxford commas.

| Use | Don't use |
|---|---|
| Select the appropriate checkbox (BU, Division, Entity, and Segment) | Select the appropriate checkbox (BU, Division, Entity and Segment) |

Use colons instead of dashes to introduce items.

| Use | Don't use |
|---|---|
| To retrieve finalized statements in the task workflow: | To retrieve finalized statements in the task workflow â€” |

Capitalize the first word after a colon.

| Use | Don't use |
|---|---|
| **Note**: Always capitalize the first word after the colon. | **Note**: always capitalize the first word after the colon. |

Don't use bold punctuation, such as the period after the bolded statement.

Include a period at the end of items in a bulleted list with more than three words. Keep each list consistent. If a period is added, add it to all items, and vice versa.

Place periods *outside* of quotation marks when they aren't part of a direct quote.

| Use | Don't use |
|---|---|
| This topic lists the available columns and its source for Stripe's "Debt roll forward". | This topic lists the available columns and its source for Stripe's "Debt roll forward." |

## Tables

Column headings should be in sentence case and explain the contents within each column.
