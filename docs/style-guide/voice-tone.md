# Voice and tone

Engineers are often intelligent and busy. Don't talk down to them or waste their time on your documentation.

- Always use active voice rather than passive voice.
- Content should be formal but friendly. Don't be afraid to use the second person (and the word "you").
- Before writing, think about what the reader wants to know â€” not what you want to tell them. How does this topic make their job easier?
- Engineers aren't reading your documentation for fun. They want to get in, find what they need, and get out.
- Reduce wordiness. Get to the point.
- Write for *people*, not for groups or bots.
- Assume everyone knows how to use a computer and its basic functionality. You don't have to describe every process or item or what happens when they click on every button. Use discretion.

## Everyday language (EDL)

Everyday language (EDL) uses simple word choices to reduce complexity. EDL is *not* about dumbing down your content; it's about increasing clarity and consistency. The US government considers using EDL so important that [it's the law](https://plainlanguage.gov/law). Remember:

- Keep it conversational.
- [Choose the correct words](language-choices.md) and use them consistently.
- Avoid jargon.
- Write short sentences.
- Use contractions.
- Stick to your topic.
