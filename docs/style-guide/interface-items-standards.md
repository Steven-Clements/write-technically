# Interface items and standards

All UI items should be marked with **bold** text, including buttons, tabs, and hovers. The only other use for bold text is when introducing list items.

Use *italics* when introducing a new term or for emphasis. *Don't* use bold for emphasis or in place of a heading.

Surround file and folder paths with backticks for all operating systems: `c:\temp, use/bin`.

## Acting on items

Always use *select* when referring to an action, such as a tab, menu option, or item in a list box. For example:

> Select **Autofit All Columns** from the **MySql** menu if you want to size columns automatically.

Click (*not* click on) buttons.

- Click links, but *don't* use click here. Use the title of the link when possible. Otherwise, use angle brackets (`<>`).
- Hover over links to display tool tips.
