## Phrase clarification

Use *information* when describing information entered by users, and *data* when referring to the entered information.

Write *Back up* and *set up* as two words and use them as verbs.

Use a hyphen to separate a word beginning with "re" if it becomes another word without the hyphen, such as the re-creation of a job as opposed to recreation as a fun activity.

Always use **select** when referring to an action, such as selecting a tab, menu option, or item in a list box. For example:

> Select **Autofit All Columns** from the **MySql** menu if you want to size columns automatically.
